## 🚀 Next Steps (Your Action Required)

### 1. Deploy to Vercel
Your code is already on GitHub, so Vercel should auto-deploy. If not:
```bash
vercel --prod
```

### 2. Add Environment Variables
Go to Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
Copy ALL values from your `.env.local` file

### 3. Verify Google OAuth (CRITICAL)
- Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
- Find your OAuth client
- Verify redirect URIs include:
  - `https://fmuhjcrbwuoisjwuvreg.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
  - `https://heartsmail.com/auth/callback`

### 4. Configure Stripe Webhook
- Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
- Add endpoint: `https://heartsmail.com/api/stripe/webhook`
- Select all subscription and payment events

### 5. Test Your Live Site
- Test signup/login
- Test Google OAuth
- Test dashboard access
- Test recipient management
- Test email scheduling
- Test Stripe checkout
