# 📧 Email Sender Configuration Explanation

## 🎯 What We Changed

### Before:
- **Auth emails**: Sent from Supabase's default templates
- **Regular emails**: Sent from `noreply@letter.heartsmail.com`
- **User experience**: Generic Supabase emails for auth flows

### After:
- **Auth emails**: Sent from `support.heartsmail@gmail.com` with beautiful HeartMail branding
- **Regular emails**: Still sent from `noreply@letter.heartsmail.com` (unchanged)
- **User experience**: Professional, branded emails for all auth flows

## ✅ Supabase Links Still Work

### Why Links Continue to Work:

1. **Same Supabase Endpoints**: The confirmation URLs still point to your Supabase project's auth endpoints
   - Example: `https://your-project.supabase.co/auth/v1/verify?token=...`

2. **Unchanged Auth Flow**: We're only changing the **email sender**, not the **authentication logic**
   - `supabase.auth.updateUser()` still works
   - `supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail()` still works
   - All Supabase auth functions remain unchanged

3. **Custom Email Templates**: We're using our own email templates but with the same Supabase confirmation URLs

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Email Flow:
1. **User requests** email change/password reset
2. **Supabase** generates confirmation token
3. **Our API** sends branded email with Supabase URL
4. **User clicks** link in our branded email
5. **Supabase** processes the confirmation (same as before)

### What Changed:
- ✅ Email sender: `support.heartsmail@gmail.com`
- ✅ Email design: Beautiful HeartMail branding
- ✅ User experience: Professional, on-brand emails

### What Stayed the Same:
- ✅ Supabase auth endpoints
- ✅ Confirmation URLs
- ✅ Authentication logic
- ✅ Database operations

## 📋 Summary
